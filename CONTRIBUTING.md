When updating the code, all edits should go into `bibedu.nw`. The `.sty`, 
`.bib` and `.mk` files are generated --- they're kept in the repo for easier 
inclusion when the repo is used as a submodule.

Please [fork the repository][ForkARepo], make your changes, commit them and 
then create a [pull request][PullRequest] in the original repository.
