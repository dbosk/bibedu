\chapter{Introduction}

This is the documentation of the [[bibedu]] bibliography and acronyms library.
It consists of three parts:
[[<<bibedu.bib>>]] which is a bibliography,
[[<<bibedu.sty>>]] which contains acronym definitions and other useful LaTeX 
tools, and
[[<<bibedu.mk>>]] which is a make include file to use with makefiles.

The [[<<bibedu.sty>>]] package depends on the [[acro]] package and [[biblatex]], 
it also automatically includes the bibliography for use with BibLaTeX.
<<bibedu.sty>>=
\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}[1999/12/01]
\ProvidesPackage{bibedu}[2019/08/18 v0.2 Bibliography and Library for Education]
\RequirePackage{biblatex}
\addbibresource{bibedu.bib}
\RequirePackage{acrox}
@ Now we can add acronyms and other code by adding it to [[<<bibedu.sty>>]].
<<bibedu.sty>>=
\DeclareAcronym{CS}{
  short = {CS},
  long = {computer science},
}
\DeclareAcronym{CSE}{
  short = {CSE},
  long = {\acifused{CS}{\acs*{CS}}{\acl*{CS}} education}
}
@

The [[<<bibedu.mk>>]] include file does two things.
It provides the functionality that [[make citekey]] will open the given 
reference.
It also provides easy inclusion of the [[bibedu]] repository in other projects 
without installation in the TeX directory hierarchy.
<<bibedu.mk>>=
BIBEDU_FILES+=bibedu.bib
BIBEDU_FILES+=bibedu.sty

INCLUDE_BIBEDU?=.

<<link local copies to repo>>
<<clean up bibedu>>
<<open references for display>>
@

To use a file, TeX needs the file to be either in its directory hierarchy, or 
the local directory.
We will create a link in the local directory into the repo.
<<link local copies to repo>>=
${BIBEDU_FILES}:
	[ -e "./$@" ] || ln -sf ${INCLUDE_BIBEDU}/$@ ./$@

bibedu.sty: bibedu.bib
@ We add the last line since the package file automatically loads the 
bibliography, thus the bibliography is required if the package is used.

When cleaning, we want to remove these links.
<<clean up bibedu>>=
.PHONY: clean-depends distclean
clean-depends distclean: clean-bibedu
clean-bibedu:
	find ${BIBEDU_FILES} -type l | xargs ${RM}
@

For documentation, we want to create targets for make that can open a URL to 
the reference.
We define every citation key in the space-separated list [[BIBEDU_REFKEY]].
Then we let the variable [[URL-<citekey>]] contain a URL to the reference.
<<open references for display>>=
define bibedu_display
.PHONY: $(1)
$(1):
	xdg-open ${URL-$(1)}
endef

$(foreach ref,${BIBEDU_REFKEY},$(eval $(call bibedu_display,${ref})))

\chapter{Standard terminology and acronyms}

We have the \ac{VLE} and \ac{LMS} acronyms which are indispensable in the 
modern education landscape.
<<bibedu.sty>>=
\DeclareAcronym{VLE}{
  short = VLE,
  long = virtual learning environment,
  foreign = learning management system,
}
\DeclareAcronym{LMS}{
  short = LMS,
  long = learning management system,
  foreign = virtual learning environment,

\chapter{Didactics}

\Textcite{BoskFormalizingMathsThesis} implemented the new (2011) Swedish 
curriculum of mathematics as formal mathematics, then studied a class of 
students while teaching the material.

  abstract = {This study examines how formal mathematics can be taught in the 
  Swedish secondary school with its new curriculum for mathematics. The study 
  examines what a teaching material in formal mathematics corresponding to the 
  initial content of the course Mathematics 1c could look like, and whether 
  formal mathematics can be taught to high school students. The survey was 
  conducted with second year students from the science programme. The majority 
  of these students studied the course Mathematics D. The students described 
  themselves as not being motivated towards mathematics. The results show that 
  the content of the curriculum can be presented with formal mathematics. This 
  both in terms of requirements for content and students being able to 
  comprehend this content. The curriculum also requires that this type of 
  mathematics is introduced in the course Mathematics 1c. The results also show 
  that students are open towards and want more formal mathematics in their 
  ordinary education. They initially felt it was strange because they had never 
  encountered this type of mathematics before, but some students found the 
  formal mathematics to be easier than the mathematics ordinarily presented in 
  class. The study finds no reason to postpone the meeting with the formal 
  mathematics to university level. Studentsâ€™ commitment to proof and their 
  comprehention of content suggests that formal mathematics can be introduced 
  in high school courses. This study thus concludes that the new secondary 
  school course Mathematics 1c can be formalised and therefore makes possible a 
  renewed mathematics education.},

  abstract = "Computer Science (CS) introductory courses that are offered by the Department of Information Systems at the University of Minho (UM), Portugal, seem to abound in non-motivated students. They are characterized by high failure and withdrawal rates and use mainly deductive teaching approaches. Deductive instruction begins with theories and progresses to applications of those theories. Active approaches to teaching are more inductive. Inductive instruction begins with the presentation of, for instance, a specific problem that introduces a topic, and theories are studied on a need-to-know basis. This pilot study describes how active learning techniques have been successfully applied to a \{CS\} introductory course, reducing its failure and withdrawal rates. The study portrays the changes in the course from teacher-centered education to a learner-centered approach, using two different editions of the same course, the first one being teacher-centered and the second learner-centered. The results in terms of success, failure, and dropout are given and the impact of a more student-centered approach on student involvement in learning is analyzed. The authors discuss implications of student-centered learning for the classroom and pay attention to some of the drawbacks of an implementation more focused on active learning. "

\chapter{Research methodology}

\Textcite{MeasuringActualOrFeelingOfLearning} evaluates students' feeling of 
learning and actual learning to compare traditional and active learning.
The students prefer traditional lectures over active learning and think they 
learn best using traditional lectures.
However, they actually learn better with active learning, but still they prefer 
traditional lectures.

\Textcite{ActionResearch} describes action research as \blockcquote{%
  Action research aims to facilitate insight, develop a teaching practice that 
  is reactive and reflective, positively impact the school community and the 
  educational environment, as well as help students be better learners%
}.
It works by iterating cycles of action~\cite{ActionResearch}:
\begin{description}
\item[Planning]
Identify problem, formulate research questions, \etc

\item[Action/implementation]
Use the implementation, perform the action.

\item[Observation/evaluation]
Observe the outcomes, evaluate the action.

\item[Critical reflection]
Reflect on the evaluation and the whole action.
Identify a new problem and start the process from the beginning again.

\Textcite{DesignBasedResearch} gives a short introduction to \ac{DBR} and its 
progress.
They write in the abstract:
\blockcquote{DesignBasedResearch}{%
  Design-based research (DBR) evolved near the beginning of the 21st century 
  and was heralded as a practical research methodology that could effectively 
  bridge the chasm between research and practice in formal education. In this 
  article, the authors review the characteristics of DBR and analyze the five 
  most cited DBR articles from each year of this past decade. They illustrate 
  the context, publications, and most popular interventions utilized. They
