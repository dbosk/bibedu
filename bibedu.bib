  abstract = {This study examines how formal mathematics can be taught in the 
  Swedish secondary school with its new curriculum for mathematics. The study 
  examines what a teaching material in formal mathematics corresponding to the 
  initial content of the course Mathematics 1c could look like, and whether 
  formal mathematics can be taught to high school students. The survey was 
  conducted with second year students from the science programme. The majority 
  of these students studied the course Mathematics D. The students described 
  themselves as not being motivated towards mathematics. The results show that 
  the content of the curriculum can be presented with formal mathematics. This 
  both in terms of requirements for content and students being able to 
  comprehend this content. The curriculum also requires that this type of 
  mathematics is introduced in the course Mathematics 1c. The results also show 
  that students are open towards and want more formal mathematics in their 
  ordinary education. They initially felt it was strange because they had never 
  encountered this type of mathematics before, but some students found the 
  formal mathematics to be easier than the mathematics ordinarily presented in 
  class. The study finds no reason to postpone the meeting with the formal 
  mathematics to university level. Students’ commitment to proof and their 
  comprehention of content suggests that formal mathematics can be introduced 
  in high school courses. This study thus concludes that the new secondary 
  school course Mathematics 1c can be formalised and therefore makes possible a 
  renewed mathematics education.},

  abstract = "Computer Science (CS) introductory courses that are offered by the Department of Information Systems at the University of Minho (UM), Portugal, seem to abound in non-motivated students. They are characterized by high failure and withdrawal rates and use mainly deductive teaching approaches. Deductive instruction begins with theories and progresses to applications of those theories. Active approaches to teaching are more inductive. Inductive instruction begins with the presentation of, for instance, a specific problem that introduces a topic, and theories are studied on a need-to-know basis. This pilot study describes how active learning techniques have been successfully applied to a \{CS\} introductory course, reducing its failure and withdrawal rates. The study portrays the changes in the course from teacher-centered education to a learner-centered approach, using two different editions of the same course, the first one being teacher-centered and the second learner-centered. The results in terms of success, failure, and dropout are given and the impact of a more student-centered approach on student involvement in learning is analyzed. The authors discuss implications of student-centered learning for the classroom and pay attention to some of the drawbacks of an implementation more focused on active learning. "
